# Fruit-Recognition-with-Deep-Learning


This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing and counting apples, oranges, and apples. The system, designed to operate on real-time camera images, will be trained with fruit photographs taken from various angles and backgrounds. The performance of the developed models will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, detection speed, memory usage, and training time.

Among the project steps are capturing fruit photos, preprocessing images, designing at least three different deep learning models, training them, and evaluating their performance on a validation set. The success of the project will be assessed using metrics including accuracy, detection speed, memory usage, and training time.

The project report will comprise sections focusing on the project's general objectives, methods employed, findings, and evaluation criteria, including an introduction, methods, findings, discussion, and conclusion. Success criteria for the project include the accuracy and speed of the model, appropriate model selection, application capability, detailed reporting, depth of analysis, and presentation quality.

The project codes, trained models, and report will be delivered on the specified date. This document provides a comprehensive guide for readers to understand and evaluate all stages of the project.
